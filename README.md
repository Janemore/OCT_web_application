## 1. Our Task

We aim to build a machine learning model to predict a patient's response to Anti-VEGF treatment, who was diagnosed with Diabetic macular edema(DME). After observing the retinal images before treatment and images after 6-months treatment, we could give suggestions to our patients on whether they should consider long-term anti-VEGF injection or not.

## 2. Data
 Our data is public OCT and it's labeling data provided by the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society, Rajavithi Hospital (Thailand) and Aravind Eye Hospital (India), which contains OCT images of both right eyes and left eyes, before and 6 months after the first treatment, as well as labeling of diseases listed below: 

    IRF (Intraretinal Fluid) 
    SRF (Subretinal Fluid)
    PED (Pigment Epithelial Detachment)
    HRF (Hyperreflective Foci)


## Medical Background 

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a rapidly growing epidemic in the United States, and it is expected to affect 592 million individuals within the next 20 years. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is one of the most common ophthalmic complications of DM. DME, occurring in 3â€“9% of patients with diabetes, is a sight-threatening condition arising in cases of diabetic retinopathy. In the United States, the overall weighted prevalence of DME is 3.8%, or about 746,000 individuals over 40 years of age. 

Chronic hyperglycemia causes an upregulation of the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), thus increasing vascular permeability and increased angiogenesis.  Among the different treatments for DME, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy, compared with laser photocoagulation and steroid treatment, has been shown to lead to superior visual outcomes.

The treatment response of DME after anti-VEGF injection differs amoung patients. To better understand the prognosis of DME after anti-VEGF therapy, several clinical biomarkers have been correlated with treatment outcomes, including central foveal thickness (CFT), external limiting membrane disruption, ellipsoid zone disruption, subretinal fluid (SRF), and presence of hyperreflective foci (HRF). Bolz et al. initially reported the presence of HRF and their characteristics on optical coherence tomography (OCT) in DME patients DME, but their nature remained unclear despite several possible origins having been proposed, including lipid extravasation from a compromised vasculature, microglia proliferation, or retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) migration. In addition, previous studies have also reported controversial results regarding the correlation between HRF and visual acuity, especially that the presence of HRF in different retinal layers at baseline might impact visual improvement after anti-VEGF therapy differently.
